# Recipe Converter
Convert all units in a recipe from US to metric or vice versa.

It is a working prototype with a limited command line interface. It has not been tested much yet.

## Features

* Handles some fractions, both as ascii or unicode characters and in plain text, i.e. 1 1/4 cups or 3Â¾.
* Automatically selects the "closest" unit in conversions. Currently, this is rather primitive.

## Example
The recipe with US units (http://www.foodista.com/recipe/WGMZ84YQ/peanut-butter-cookie-recipe):

## To Do:

* Test a lot more.
    * Round trip testing with real recipes.
* UK/Imperial units.
* Improve closest-unit function. Make it round trip safe 1 cup -> 2.4 dl -> 1 cup.
    * Preferred units. dl > cl.
    * Sometimes integer units should be preferred over fractions. 4 tbsp is better than 0.6 dl.
* Command line configuration. Units to include or exclude.
